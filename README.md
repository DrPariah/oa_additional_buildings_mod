Oa's additional buildings mod (version 1.0)

Adds 10 more buildings into the game, including 2 multiple Z-level buildings.

contents:

City buildings/structures:
- city dump (small)
- gardening allotment
- internet cafe
- outdoor market (small)
- open sewer
- private park
- sex shop
		
Outer buildings/structures:
- hunter's camp
- giant sinkhole (2 Z-levels)
- watch tower (3 Z-levels)
		
Notes: 

If you wish to prevent any one building from generating,
find it in either "overmap_specials.json" and set it's '"occurrences":'
stat to "[0,0]". Alternatively, find the building in "regional_overlay.json"
and change it's respective "city" stat to zero; (e.g. '"s_open_sewer": 0,')
		
Although I have attempted to balance these buildings' (item drops and monster spawns),
it is difficult to gauge whether or not they are balanced relative to the rest of the game.
		
Feedback welcome via github.
